TickerWidget
============
This is a simple ticker that pulls in the price of a Bitcoin and displays the price in a variety of currencies. The prices are pulled from either Bitstamp or BTC-e, and are updated every 10 seconds. Exchange rates are pulled from www.getexchangerates.com. Vector graphics were pulled from a forgotten public resource, but are much appreciated.

This can be seen in action at:

DEPLOYMENT:
